  <div id="About Me">
    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>As a Hedge Fund Credit Risk Analyst at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking (SGCIB), I contributed to the monitoring and reporting of the credit risk exposure of a portfolio of hedge funds, using VBA programming and Excel skills. I also supported the development and implementation of risk management policies and procedures, and collaborated with internal and external stakeholders. Prior to joining SGCIB, I gained valuable experience as a rewards analyst at The Adecco Group, and equity solutions intern at River Global Investors previously River and Mercantile Group, where I applied my analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills to various projects and tasks. I hold a BSc (Hons) in Actuarial Science from University of Kent, and I am currently pursuing a MSc in Quantitative Finance at Bayes Business School, where I am enhancing my knowledge and skills in financial modeling, research, risk analysis, and data science. I am passionate about learning new things, challenging myself, and delivering high-quality work. I am looking for opportunities to leverage my quantitative finance and risk management skills in a dynamic and innovative environment.</p>
